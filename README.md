# 3D-Product-Website

## Check out website here: 

## I have made a website that uses ThreeJS. 

### Some features

- It uses the DALLE API to generate images. These images can be overlayed on top of the product as a logo. 
- The user can also upload their own custom logo from their computer.
- The user can change the color of the product
