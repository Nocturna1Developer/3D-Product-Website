# 3D-Product-Website

## Check out project here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9VQWD5IFus&ab_channel=NOKTURNALGAMEDEV

## I have made a website that uses ThreeJS. 

### Some features
- The website has a 3D product on the home page.
- It uses the DALLE API to generate images. These images can be overlayed on top of the product as a logo. 
- The user can also upload their own custom logo from their computer.
- The user can change the color of the product
